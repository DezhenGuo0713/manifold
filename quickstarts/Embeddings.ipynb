        "\n",
        "When generating embeddings, especially for complex systems like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a one-size-fits-all approach can sometimes lead to lower-quality results. For instance, a question like \"Why is the sky blue?\" and its answer, \"The scattering of sunlight causes the blue color,\" have distinct meanings as statements, and a general-purpose embedding model might not recognize their strong relationship. To solve this, you can specify a `task_type` when creating embeddings. This instructs the model to produce vectors that are specifically optimized for your intended use case, which can significantly improve performance while also saving time and cost.\n",

        "*   **`RETRIEVAL_QUERY`** and **`RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`**: These are essential for information retrieval tasks. Use `RETRIEVAL_QUERY` for the user's search query and `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT` for the texts in your database that you want to search through. This is the foundation for building effective semantic search and RAG systems.\n",
        "*   **`CLASSIFICATION`**: Choose this task type when you intend to use the embeddings to train a model that classifies text into a set of predefined categories.\n",
